# SME0300 - Numerical Analysis

Repository for the Numerical Analysis course offered for electronic engineering undergraduates at EESC - USP, by professor Maria Lu√≠sa Bambozzi.

This repository contains numerical methods for finding solutions of a nonlinear equation, as well as nonlinear and linear equations' systems. In order to use it, you must've [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) installed and run the main.py file.
